# Intro to Runes 
In this example I am just messing with a few Rune examples to cross data between component <---> page. 

I am mostly basing my examples off the currently in-the-works documentation for [Svelte 5](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes). 

Notably, so far I am using: 
 - $inpect
 - $effect
 - $bindable 
 - $props

To run this project, first run: 
```bash
npm install
```
Then you can start the dev server: 
```bash
npm run dev
```

This is mostly a discovery phase for me, but feel free to ask any questions.
